## Install
`ember install ember-initials`

## Usage

### Quick start
Ember Initials gives you a built-in component which you can use in yours templates:

```hbs
{{ember-initials name="John Doe"}}
```

It will generate an avatar with `JD` initials.

### Customization
You can pass options to the `{{ember-initials}}` directive or extend your Component with a mixin:

```js
import Initials from 'ember-initials/mixin';

export default Ember.Component.extend(Initials, {
  // your extensions
});
```
** Full list of options is available right in the code (mixin.js). If you read this probably you know what you are doing ;) **


### Examples
Bellow you can find some code examples with usage of available options.

#### Font customization
You can customize font by these arguments:
```
{{ember-initials
  name="John Doe"
  textColor='white'
  fontSize='12px'
  fontWeight=200
  fontFamily='Helvetica Neue Light, Arial, sans-serif'}}
```

#### Size
To change the size of avatar add `size` options (size in pixels):
```hbs
{{ember-initials name="John Doe" size=40}}
```

#### Seed Text
Seed text is a background color id generated through uniq string. By default it is a `name`.

```hbs
{{ember-initials name="John Doe"}}
```
Eg. It will return avatar with `red` background.

```hbs
{{ember-initials name="John Doe" seedText=user.email}}
```
Now it will return avatar with `blue` background.

#### Default name and background color
To change the default name and background color of avatar add `defaultName` and `defaultBackground` options:

```hbs
{{ember-initials
  name="John Doe"
  defaultName='!?'
  defaultBackground="#dd6a58"}}
```
